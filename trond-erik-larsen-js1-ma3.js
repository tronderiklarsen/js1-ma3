/*
Too complicated to solve with what "we have learned". 
The last couple of weeks have been more confusing than
anything else. It was fine until Module 1 - Lesson 3.
Everything after that has been just copying code that
already has been written by somebody else, without thinking
for ourselves. The learning curve has been too steep, and 
every lesson involving RAWG API has too much information 
per lesson. New stuff getting introduced too quick, with little
explaination. I get nothing out of it, except getting more 
and more demotivated. If I can't solve the module assignments 
from reading and doing lesson assignments, and without getting 
help every single step, then what's the point? I think alot of
people in our class will fall off after Module 2 and 3 of
Javascript 1. I'm starting to think this isn't for me... 
I doubt I'll even do the second year.
